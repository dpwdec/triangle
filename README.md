## Spec

Test project with RSpec to build a triangle class that can:
+ store coordinate information A, B, C about the triangle
+ calculate the distance between two points
+ calculate a vector between two points
+ calculate an angle between two vectors
+ calculate an angle between three points
+ convert radians to degrees
+ calculate the sides of a triangle
+ calculate the angles of the triangle
+ calculate the area of the triangle
